Instructions:

Firefox must be installed on the machine that it will be run from.  Future versions will support other browsers but for
now only Firefox is supported.

This can either be compiled as an executable jar or run as a project within eclipse.

First, acquire the Selenium libraries and their dependencies from the WaveformTests-dependencies folder in Dropbox.  Copy the WaveformTests-dependencies folder into the projects-dependencies folder in liferay

If running as a standalone executable:

2)  Run the ant script to build the executable jar.  By default it will place the jar in /opt/liferay/testing

3)  At the command line, type:

java -jar WaveformTests.jar <host> <username> <password> <desired_logfile_location> <location_of_config_file>

Note:  The ant script copies over a default config file into the /opt/liferay/testing folder that is ready to use.


If running from within Eclipse:  

1)  Add the Selenium libraries to the build path

2)  Go to Run -> Run Configurations

3)  Go to the Arguments tab

4)  Under the "Program Arguments" field, enter the value for each command line argument in the order presented in Step 3 of 
	running this project as a standalone jar.  Each argument must be on a separate line.
	
5)  Click Apply, and then click Run.

After the initial configuration is set up, all that is required is to run the program through Eclipse.  This also allows for 
running in debug mode as well.  To change the command line arguments simply return to the Run COnfigurations screen and follow the steps
above.
